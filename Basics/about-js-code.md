# About Javascript Code and Parsing and Executing it

## Parsing and Order of Code Execution

1. You can define functions either in top or in other places of the code , because the js engine at first in the parsing phase , will begin to gather all functions and top and registers them , so **order does not matters for functions in the javascript code** but , **order matters for variables and constants**
2. If you connect multiple javascript sources to your html file , from top of the html to down of it , they will begin to parse and execute sequentially and you can access to functions and variables that are exists in previous files
