# More info about JS Engines

1. first of all , in Browsers like google chrome and firefox and etc ... , we have javascript engines (like v8 in chrome , spidermonkey in firefox , ...) and something else that is called **Event Loop** that is not contained in javascript engine and it's something beside the javascript engine in the browser and it is supplied by the browser. It helps us to write **Asynchronous Codes** beside the **Singe-Threaded Javascript Engine**.
2. The browser also providing **Browser API** to use javascript Codes to manipulate **Event Loop** and **HTML DOM** and this Browser API will act like a communication bridges between Event Loop and HTML DOM.
