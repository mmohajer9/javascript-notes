## What is This

My own personal experience , tells me that every time you work with javascript , there are something new that you don't know them yet. i think the weird part is the moment that you think you understand , but its not true :smile:

## Other Good Resources for Javascript (Except Official Documentation [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript))

1. [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) : one of the best modern tutorials that categorize topics in a good fashion.
2. [Refactoring Guru and Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/) : makes it easy for you to discover everything you need to know about refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles, and other smart programming topics

## Credit
