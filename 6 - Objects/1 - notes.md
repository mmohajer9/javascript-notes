# Notes on Objects in Javascript

1. There are many ways to create object or modify the object by adding properties or deleting them and etc.
2. To get a good sight on objects , just take a look at this sample code:

   ```javascript
   let userChosenKeyName = "age";

   let person = {
     "first-name": "mamad",
     "last name": "mamal",
     [userChosenKeyName]: 30,
     2.5: "Hey !",
     grade: "diploma",
   };

   // multiple ways of accessing objects properties
   console.log(person.grade); // dot notation
   console.log(person[userChosenKeyName]); // using the values that stored in variable
   console.log(person["first-name"]); // using square brackets
   console.log(person[2.5]); // same as console.log(person['2.5'])

   // adding properties
   person.gender = "male";

   // deleting the property
   delete person.grade;
   ```

3. Objects Property Shorthand Syntax :

   ```javascript
   let title = "1984";
   let author = "George Orwell";

   // we can create a book object with given data like this
   let book = {
     // keyname : value -> value is stored in variable
     title: title,
     author: author,
   };

   // we can simply do this
   let book_shorthand = {
     title,
     author,
   };
   ```

4. You can use Spread Operator (...) with objects too ! but be careful of Shallow Copy and Deep Copy problems when you have referenced values in an object for example :

   ```javascript
   let person = {
     name: "mamad",
     age: 30,
     array: [1, 2, 3], // this is a referenced value
   };

   // array is Shallow copied into person2 not Deep copy
   // but not the other primitive types
   let person2 = { ...person };

   // correct way of Deep Copy
   let person2 = { ...person, array: [...person.array] };
   ```

5. Another way of Copying objects that is available before ES6 and more , is **`Object.assign(target , ...source)`** , e.g. :

   ```javascript
   let person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
   ```

   This method of copy also does a Shallow Copy by default like the spread operator (...)

6. Objects Destructuring

   ```javascript
   let person = {
     age: 30,
     name: "Mamad",
     last_name: "Mohajer",
     array: [1, 2, 3],
   };

   const { age, name, ...otherProps } = person;
   // take care of variable names between curly braces
   // you can only use the names of key names that are existing in that object
   // but this rule will not apply for the variable with rest operator (...)
   // the variable with rest operator (otherProps) will be the object with the remaining keys and values
   ```

   1. The **difference** between Objects Destructuring and Arrays Destructuring is , **in objects destructuring for making variables , you should only use the key name that exists in that object that you wanna to destructure between the curly braces and in the otherwise , it will return undefined for that variables**, but in arrays destructuring you can use any names for your variables between square brackets.
      and also , you can use **any names** for your variables when the variable has **Rest Operator `(...variable_name)`**

   2. and also if you wanna **change the name of the variable between curly braces** you can use this notation :

      ```javascript
      let { name: firstName } = person;
      ```

      note that you should first give the right key name value of that object then you can change variable name with `:` like this :
      **`keyName : desiredVariableName`**

7. How to check the existence of a property in an object ?

   ```javascript
   let person = {
     age: 30,
     name: "Mamad",
     last_name: "Mohajer",
     array: [1, 2, 3],
   };

   // checking with 'in' keyword
   console.log("age" in person); // returns true

   // checking with equality to undefined
   console.log(person.age !== undefined);
   ```

8. About **`this`** Keyword Behaviour In Objects for Normal Functions (not arrow functions):

   1. **`this`** does not automatically refer to the object that kind of surrounds it
   2. **`this`** refers to who or what was responsible for calling this function , **it is very very important !** , note that this tip was for normal functions like **`function(){...}`** **not arrow functions** like **`(...) => {...}`**
   3. consider the following code :

      ```javascript
      let btn = document.querySelector("#submit-btn"); // get the submit button element

      const someFunc = function () {
        console.log(this); // this will output the button element
      };

      btn.addEventListener("click", someFunc);
      ```

      In this case the **`this`** object will refer to the object that is responsible for triggering that **`someFunc`** function and it will return the button object element.

   4. **`this`** that refers to global **`window`** object , will be **`undefined`** **if we use strict mode** , i mean : **`use strict`**
   5. In summary : normal functions will change the binding of **`this`**

9. About **`this`** Keyword Behaviour In Objects for Arrow Functions **`((...) => {...})`**:

   1. Arrow functions **don't bind `this` to anything !**
   2. **`this`** is not overwritten by the function , instead it refers to exact same thing that it would refer to outside of the function.
   3. strict mode **does not** any changes on **`this`** behaviour in arrow functions
   4. **`.bind()`** method in functions does not affect arrow functions
   5. Arrow Functions don't bind **`this`** to anything , instead they keep the context , it means the this will be bind to what ever it is outside of the function.
   6. Arrow functions don't change the binding of **`this`**

10. Getters and Setters :

    ```javascript
    let person = {
      firstName: "Mamad",
      lastName: "Mohajer",
      age: 30,
      // new syntax
      set jobTitle(value) {
        if (value.trim()) {
          // make a new property here
          // we can access to this property from getters and setters
          // not directly and its internal
          this._jobTitle = value;
        } else {
          this._jobTitle = "DEFAULT";
          return;
        }
      },
      get jobTitle() {
        return this._jobTitle;
      },
    };
    ```

    How can we work and access to this getters and setters ?

    ```javascript
    // getting the property
    console.log(person.jobTitle);

    // setting the property
    person.jobTitle = "Computer Scientist";
    ```

    it is very useful when you want to change the behaviour of accessing the properties or the behaviour of setting the properties

11. Object Descriptors

    1. Every Property you add and every method you add is basiaclly a property which holds an objecct that is called **Descriptor**. So , How to get that ?
    2. To get property descriptor use this :

       ```javascript
       Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, "propertyKeyName");

       // or for getting all descriptors

       Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(object);
       ```

    3. That's some metadata stored behind the scenes by javascript , it influences how the properties can be used , like some configurations and you can change them too. So how to change ?

       ```javascript
       let descriptor_object = {
         configurable: true,
         enumerable: true,
         value: "someValue",
         writable: true,
       };

       Object.defineProperty(object, "propertyKeyName", descriptor_object);
       ```
